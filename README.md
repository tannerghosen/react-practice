# Summary:
## What is this website?
This was a practice website I made using React and React Router to learn how to make websites using
React and to build ontop of my JavaScript knowledge. I made a website that re-used my main website's
stylesheet at that time and brought over (and improved on!) features that website had, such as my 
lightswitch, which led me to find a way to make the function even simpler, alongside new features such as a current time function and an GET Image function (using an API to get cat images).

## How does it accomplish this? (Code Explanation)
This was created using JavaScript and Node.js inside Visual Studio 2022 using the Create React App project option. React was the building blocks for the webpages as well as the scripts for the pages.
React-Router was used to create a Single Page Application (SPA), so we did not need to load another page up to get to another part of the site, it is all loaded when the website is loaded. Additionally, it helped establish a layout that makes it easy to add more pages onto the website.
